#Clip logic
        # If minuet is up and will drop off within the next gcd and we have more rep than 0 and next tick - .7 is greater than minuets end time - clip

#Snap logic
        # if the mod on the current dot is great than our current mod don't snap
        # if raging strikes isn't up, don't snap
        # else if our dot time is less than 10 and RS is close to drop, snap
        # if no conditions are met don't snap
