AutoGCD logic in opener(Bit depricated, just recommend letting sim handle the opener after set GCDs):

# Auto GCD in the opener
                        # If technical is active and Esprit > 80 - Use Saber Dance
                        # If we are to lose any procs do them in the following order Fountfall > Cascade >Bloodshower > windmill
                        # If we are in a buffwindow and esprit is great than or equal to 50 then use Saber Dance
                        # If we are in a combo and self.buffs['Flourishing Fountain'] is not active and our combo will drop - Use Fountain
                        # Use Flourishes in this order : Fountainfall >  Reverse Cascade > Blood > Rising
                        # If esprit is 90 or above use Saber Dance
                        # If combo use Fountain
                        # Else use Cascade

# AutoOGCD in the opener
                        # If self.abilities['Flourish'] is up, we have no procs - Use it
                        # If self.abilities['Flourish'] fan is up use FD3
                        # if we are in the buffwindow and have feathers and can use FD1 use FD1
                        # If we have 4 feathers and FD1 is up use FD1
                        # push the oGCD further if we have more feathers. at a 2.4 gcd we can get two in 


# GCD Priority List -
                # First we check if we are dancing and finish the dance
                # We check the status on technical, If we used Saber first in our opener we also check to see if Devilment is up. We also check to make there is no boss jump/delay in the 22 seconds Then we use Technical
                # If Technical is up and we have 80 or more Esprit - Use Saber
                # Check if Standard Step is up and there is no boss jump/delay in 5 seconds - If so use it
                # If we have 50 Esprit. improv is up and the boss is jumping within the next GCD we want to dump Esprit into Saber Dance
                # If we don't have a ninja in our group and we aren't using Technical step in 30s and we have no procs but flourish will be of CD within the next GCD and we have enough esprit - Use Saber
                # next we check if 1 or more dances are coming and one is next GCD and if we have Flourishing Fountain - Use Flourish Fountain

# oGCD Priority list
                    # Ignore oGCDs if dancing
                    # If Devilment is ready, and technical is the next GCD or we opened with Technical first and we are in the second oGCD slot - Use Saber
                    # If Saber is ready and technical is the next GCD or we opened with Technical first and our next GCD is greater than 1.5 away, close the ogcd slot to ensure saber gets second slot
                    # if Devilment is ready, our opener used Saber First and Technical Step is the next gcd and nextgcd is 1.7 away, wait. To ensure second oGCD slot
                    # if Flourish is available, we have 0 Flourish procs, and technical dance isn't less than 4* our Current GCD seconds away and we aren't dancing twice in the next 15, and we aren't in a buff window with 50 or more Esprit - Flourish
